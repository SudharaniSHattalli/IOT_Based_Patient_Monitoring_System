# IOT_Based_Patient_Monitoring_System

This project monitor the patient temperature,humidity and pulse rate.
And it is simulated on proteus and also it store the data(temperature,
humidity,pulserate) on Thingspeak.

#Requirements:
Arduino Mega 2560,
DHT11 Sensor,
HEARTBEAT Sensor.

#Software Requirement:
Proteous(8.9 above version ),
VSPE(Virtual Serial Port Emulator),
PyCharm,
Arduino IDE.

#The more information is given in the project report.
So, once you read that report then you may get better understand about the project.
